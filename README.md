## Start on the exercises
*Complete these exercises in a file called `dictionaries.py` in this repo.  Commit your work as you go!*

1. Create a dictionary called `my_stats` with your name, age, and height.
2. Print out the string `"[name] is [age] years old with a height of [height]."` with `[name]`, `[age]`, and `[height]` coming from your dictionary.
3. Delete your age from my_stats
4. Create a dictionary called vocabulary_words that contains 4 vocabulary words from this course as keys and their definitions as values. (Hint: Look up at the wall if you can't think of any vocabulary words.)
5. Write a program that counts how many times each letter appears in your full name. Return a dictionary that looks like this: `{'a':2, 'c':1, 'w':1}`
6. Write a program that counts how many times each letter appears in a random string. Return a dictionary that looks like this: `{'a':22, 'c':14, 'r':19, 'w':2}`
7. Write a program that counts how many times each letter appears in a file. Use the file `one_fish_two_fish.txt` in this repo to test your program. Return a dictionary.
8. Write a program that counts how many times each word appears in a random string. When given `"one fish two fish red fish blue fish"` it should return a dictionary that looks like this: `{'one':1, 'fish':4, 'two':1, 'red':1, 'blue':1}`
9. Write a program that counts how many times each word appears in a file. Use the file `one_fish_two_fish.txt` in this repo to test your program. Return a dictionary.
10. Given a dictionary of items and their prices, write a program that returns the most expensive item. Hint: Look at the last slide in Dictionary Lecture to figure out how to iterate over a dictionary!

e.g. `prices = { "banana": 4, "apple": 2, "orange": 1.5, "pear": 3 }`

Your program should return "bananas"
